Checking for super user
UID is an important environment variable that can be used to check whether the current
script has been run as a root user or regular user. For example:
If [ $UID -ne 0 ]; then
 echo Non root user. Please run as root.
else
 echo Root user
fi
The UID value for the root user is 0
