# Checking for super user
# UID is an important environment variable that can be used to check whether the current
# script has been run as a root user or regular user. For example:


If [ $UID -ne 0 ]; then
 echo Non root user. Please run as root.
else
 echo Root user
fi
The UID value for the root user is 0

# Math with the shell
# The Bash shell environment can perform basic arithmetic operations using the commands
# let, (( )), and [].

#!/bin/bash
no1=4;
no2=5;

# The let command can be used to perform basic operations directly. While using
# let, we use variable names without the $ prefix, for example:

let result=no1+no2
echo $result

    #increment operation:
    $ let no1++

    #decrement operation:
    $ let no1--

    # shorthands:
    let no+=6
    let no-=6

# The [] operator can be used in the same way as the let command as follows:

result=$[no1 + no2 ]

# Using the $ prefix inside [] operators are legal, for example:
result=$[ $no1 + 5 ]
